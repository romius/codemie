# AGENTS.md

**Purpose**: AI-optimized execution guide for agents working with the CodeMie backend repository.

Detailed project guidance lives under `.ai-run/guides/`, which is the source of truth for AI-assisted development in this repo.

## Critical Rules

<!-- ai-run-init:critical-rules start -->
| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Check Guides First | ANY task | Match request to category, load the P0 `.ai-run/guides/` guide before broad code search. |
| Testing | User asks to write, run, or fix tests | Only then work on tests; load `.ai-run/guides/testing/testing-patterns.md` first. |
| Git Operations | User asks to commit, push, create MR, or similar | Only then perform git side effects; load `.ai-run/guides/standards/git-workflow.md` first. |
| Python Environment | Python, Poetry, or tool commands | Load `.ai-run/guides/development/setup-guide.md` or `.ai-run/guides/quality-gates.md` before running. |
| Stop Hook | `make ruff` fails with `poetry: No such file or directory` | Load `.ai-run/guides/development/setup-guide.md` — see **Claude Code Stop Hook** section. |
| Shell | ANY shell command | Use bash/Linux syntax and report commands actually run. |
| Project Conventions | Any project-specific convention | Load the relevant guide; do not infer exact values from this entrypoint. |
<!-- ai-run-init:critical-rules end -->

## Repository Rules

<!-- Outside the ai-run-init managed regions on purpose: the generator preserves content
     outside its markers, and this rule is not derivable from the guides or manifests. -->

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Sanity Regression | Opening an MR that touches dependencies, the Dockerfile, or security-relevant code | This repository has no pipeline config, so nothing re-checks an MR automatically. The MR description must ask a reviewer to post `/sanity`. |

## Commands

<!-- ai-run-init:commands start -->
| Need | Source Guide | Source Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup and local environment | `.ai-run/guides/development/setup-guide.md` | README, Makefile, pyproject | Load before dependency or environment commands. |
| Run the application | `.ai-run/guides/development/setup-guide.md` | README, Makefile | Load before starting local services. |
| Lint, format, build, and verification | `.ai-run/guides/quality-gates.md` | Makefile, pyproject | Use the guide for exact commands and skip policy. |
| Tests and coverage | `.ai-run/guides/testing/testing-patterns.md` | Makefile, pytest config | Only run or write tests when explicitly requested. |
| Secure coding, auth, secret handling | `.ai-run/guides/development/security-patterns.md` | Quality gates guide, Makefile | Application-level security, not vulnerability remediation. |
| Fixing a reported CVE or scanner finding | `.ai-run/guides/security/README.md` | Makefile, pyproject, Dockerfile | Covers dependencies, image rebuild and scan, and the `/sanity` handoff. |
<!-- ai-run-init:commands end -->

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

- Requirements handled and scoped to the user request.
- Relevant `.ai-run/guides/` P0 guide was checked first.
- Project-specific exact values came from a guide, not from this entrypoint.
- Validation commands actually run are reported exactly in the final response.
- Tests are only run or written when explicitly requested.
- Git operations are only performed when explicitly requested.

## Conflict Handling

| Conflict | Action |
|---|---|
| A guide conflicts with source code | Trust current source, then update guidance only if the task owns that documentation change. |
| README and Makefile disagree on a command | Prefer the Makefile target and note the README mismatch in the response. |
| User asks for tests but scope is unclear | Ask for the intended scope or run the narrowest relevant test. |
| User asks for git work without a required work item | Ask for the missing work item before committing. |
| Existing host-specific skills disagree with `.ai-run/guides/` | Follow `.ai-run/guides/` unless the user explicitly selects the host-specific workflow. |

## Source Evidence Priority

| Evidence type | Priority |
|---|---|
| Current source files | Highest for implementation behavior. |
| `Makefile` and manifests | Highest for commands and dependencies. |
| README and contribution docs | Useful for workflow context. |
| `.ai-run/guides/` | Primary AI guidance source. |
| Host-specific skill files | Use only when that skill is explicitly invoked. |
