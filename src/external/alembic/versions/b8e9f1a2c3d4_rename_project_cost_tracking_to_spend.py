    Steps:
    1. Rename table project_cost_tracking -> project_spend_tracking

    3. Drop NOT NULL constraint on key_hash
    4. Add new nullable columns: budget_id, soft_budget, max_budget, budget_duration, spend_subject_type
    5. Backfill spend_subject_type = 'key' for all existing rows
    6. Drop old unique constraint uix_project_cost_tracking_key_hash_spend_date
    7. Add check constraints for spend_subject_type values and key_hash/budget nullability rules
    8. Add partial unique indexes for key rows and budget rows
