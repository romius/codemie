"""Built-in tool that shows interactive UI to the user in chat via A2UI.

Executing the tool validates the requested components against the A2UI Basic
Catalog, emits the surface as A2UI wire envelopes (``createSurface`` →
``updateComponents`` → optional ``updateDataModel``) into the NDJSON stream,
and ends the agent turn (``return_direct``); the user's structured answer
arrives as an ``action`` envelope with the next chat message.
