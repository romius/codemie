User context management using ContextVar.

This module provides thread-safe and async-friendly storage for the current
authenticated user during request processing. It uses Python's contextvars
to maintain user context that can be accessed from different parts of the
application without explicit parameter passing.

The user context is set during authentication and can be retrieved in
downstream components (like MCP toolkit service) for placeholder resolution
in headers and other configuration.
