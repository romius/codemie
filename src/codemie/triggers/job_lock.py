"""Cross-process locking for scheduled datasource reindex jobs.

APScheduler's ``max_instances=1`` only prevents a job from overlapping itself within a
single process. It says nothing about two pods, which is exactly the window that opens
if the trigger engine's leader lock is ever held by two nodes at once — during a
PostgreSQL failover, say, when the leader's connection dies and its lock is released
server-side while the old leader keeps running.

A PostgreSQL session-level advisory lock keyed on the datasource closes that window.
Whoever gets the lock reindexes; anyone else skips and says so. When a pod dies its
connection closes and PostgreSQL drops the lock, so there is no lease to expire, no
heartbeat to renew and no stale-lock cleanup to run.
