"""Authorization for the per-user OAuth connection endpoints.

The connect / connection / disconnect endpoints all take a caller-supplied `setting_id`.
Authenticating the caller is not enough: without an ownership check any authenticated user
who learns a setting UUID could drive a flow against an integration belonging to a project
they are not a member of, which would disclose that integration's OAuth app configuration
through the generated authorize URL.

Access is resolved through the same `Ability` model the settings routers use, so a member of
the owning project may connect, while a non-member is refused.
