    Key behaviors:
    - Get minimum required fields for search/read operations unless user requests more
    - Query API for missing required info, ask user if not found
    - For status updates: get available statuses first, compare with user input
    - File attachments: To attach files to an issue, use POST method with '/rest/api/{version}/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/attachments'
      and include the file name in params as {"file": "filename.ext"} or {"files": ["file1.ext", "file2.ext"]} for multiple files
    - Image attachments: When fetching a single issue, always include "attachment" in the requested fields
      (e.g., params={"fields": "key,summary,status,assignee,issuetype,attachment"}).
      Image attachments (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) are automatically downloaded and passed to the AI model for visual analysis.
    - Attachment transfer (opt-in): The tool never copies attachments across issues or runs image
      recognition on its own. When the user explicitly asks to copy attachments from an existing ticket
      into a newly created one, include all three params on the create-issue POST:
        params={"fields": {...issue fields...}, "source_issue_key": "ORIG-123", "copy_attachments": true}
      Add "ocr_images": true only when the user explicitly asks to extract text from image attachments;
      this runs the vision model on every image and posts a single comment with the extracted content on
      the new issue. Both flags default to false and are stripped from the request before it reaches Jira.
      Do not add these params speculatively — omit them unless the user's request makes attachment copy
      (and, separately, image OCR) an explicit part of the ask.

    JQL status transitions:
    - Basic: status CHANGED TO "Status" BY "user@example.com" DURING (startOfMonth(-1), endOfMonth(-1))
    - Specific transition: status CHANGED FROM "Status1" TO "Status2" BY "user@example.com" (only when user explicitly asks about FROM/TO)
    - DURING period formats:
      * Specific dates with time: DURING ('2025/10/01 00:00', '2025/10/20 23:59')
      * This month: DURING (startOfMonth(), endOfMonth())
      * Last month: DURING (startOfMonth(-1), endOfMonth(-1))
      * This week: DURING (startOfWeek(), endOfWeek())
      * Last week: DURING (startOfWeek(-1), endOfWeek(-1))
      * Last 2 weeks: DURING (startOfWeek(-1), endOfWeek())
      * Last 30 days: DURING (-30d, now())

    JQL for "completed/done/implemented/developed" queries to track work contribution:
    - CRITICAL: Each status change needs its own BY clause. NEVER: (status CHANGED TO "X" OR status CHANGED TO "Y") BY "user"
    - For queries like "tickets completed/implemented/done by user X in period Y", combine THREE approaches:
      1. User closed ticket: (status CHANGED TO "Closed" BY "user@example.com" DURING (period) OR status CHANGED TO "Done" BY "user@example.com" DURING (period))
      2. User WAS assignee: (assignee WAS "user@example.com" AND status IN ("Closed", "Done") AND updated >= relativeDate)
      3. User IS assignee: (assignee = "user@example.com" AND status IN ("Closed", "Done") AND updated >= relativeDate)
    - Example last week: ((status CHANGED TO "Closed" BY "user@example.com" DURING (startOfWeek(-1), endOfWeek(-1)) OR status CHANGED TO "Done" BY "user@example.com" DURING (startOfWeek(-1), endOfWeek(-1))) OR (assignee WAS "user@example.com" AND status IN ("Closed", "Done") AND updated >= -7d) OR (assignee = "user@example.com" AND status IN ("Closed", "Done") AND updated >= -7d))
    - This captures tickets where user: closed it, worked on it (was assignee), or is responsible for it (current assignee)
    - Status names are case-sensitive: use "Closed", "Done" (not "CLOSED", "DONE"). Query project statuses if unsure.
    - For updated field: use relative dates like -7d, -30d (NOT date functions in comparison operators)

    Key capabilities:
    - Create, update, search, and manage Jira issues
    - Attach files and documents to issues
    - Manage projects, sprints, and workflows
    - Query issue status, assignees, and metadata

    Before using it, it is necessary to add a new integration for the tool by providing:
    1. Alias (A friendly name for the Jira integration)
    2. Jira URL
    3. Username/email for Jira (Required for Jira Cloud)
    4. Token (API token or Personal Access Token)

    Usage Note:
    Use this tool when you need to manage Jira issues, projects, sprints, retrieve information from your Jira environment, or attach files to issues.
