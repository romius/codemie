    1. Alias (A friendly name for the filesystem access)
    2. Root directory (The base directory for file operations)
    Usage Note:
    Useful when CodeMie backend is installed locally and you need to retrieve the contents of a specific file for local development purposes.

    user_description="""
    Updates an existing file in the local filesystem. Uses a "diff" edit format, asking the Large Language Model (LLM) to specify file edits as a series of search/replace blocks. This tool is typically used to support local development activities.
    Before using it, it is necessary to add a new integration for the tool by providing:
    1. Alias (A friendly name for the local filesystem access)
    2. Root directory (The base directory for file operations on your local machine)
    Usage Note:
    Useful when CodeMie backend is installed locally and you need to make specific changes to files during local development. This tool is efficient as the model only needs to return parts of the file which have changes. It usually performs on par with "Write file" for small files and much better for large files.

    * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
    * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
    * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
    * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
    * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

    Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
    * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
    * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
    * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`
