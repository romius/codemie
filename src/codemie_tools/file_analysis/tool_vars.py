FILE_ANALYSIS_TOOL = ToolMetadata(
    name="file_analysis",
    description="""
    Use this tool to read the content of files and convert it into markdown format.
    It supports various file types such as plain text files, HTML, zip archives, etc.
    This tool ensures that content is structured and easy to read with markdown syntax.
    Do not use this tool for PDFs, PowerPoint presentations (PPTX), Excel files (XLS/XLSX/XLSB), Word documents (DOCX),
    CSV files, or email files (EML/MSG), as separate tools handle those formats.
    Call this tool when tasks involve reading and analyzing file content or
    extracting information in a structured, markdown-friendly format. The output will include elements like headers,
    lists, tables, and more, converted into an easy-to-read markdown style. Useful for tasks like summarization,
    knowledge extraction, or reasoning based on file input.

EMAIL_TOOL = ToolMetadata(
    name="email_analysis_tool",
    description="""
    Use this tool to read and analyze email files (EML and MSG formats).
    By default it returns the email headers (From, To, Subject, Date, Cc), the message body,
    and a list of attached file names with their sizes — no attachment content is extracted
    unless the user explicitly requests it.
    To analyze one or more attachments, provide their filenames in the `attachment_names`
    parameter; the tool will then extract and return the content of each requested attachment
    using the appropriate specialized file-analysis tool (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, or generic).

    IMPORTANT — trigger conditions (use this tool, do NOT use a web scraper or refuse):
    - The user uploads or references an EML or MSG file.
    - The user provides a URL that ends with .eml or points to a raw email file
      (e.g. "summarize this email: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../email.eml").
      Pass the URL directly to the `url` parameter — this tool fetches the file internally.
      Never attempt to scrape such a URL with a web browser/scraper tool.
    - The user pastes raw email text or a Base64-encoded email into the message.
      Pass it to the `inline_content` parameter.

    Input sources (at least one required):
    - Uploaded .eml/.msg file attachment (default, injected automatically by the platform).
    - `url` parameter: a publicly accessible URL pointing directly to a .eml file
      (e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../email.eml). Only http/https are accepted;
      private or internal addresses are blocked for security.
    - `inline_content` parameter: the raw .eml content provided as a Base64-encoded string
      or as plain RFC-5322 text. Useful when email data is available in memory or via API.

    Multiple sources can be combined; the tool analyzes all of them and returns their results
    separated by horizontal rules.

PPTX_TOOL = ToolMetadata(
    name="pptx_tool",
    description="""
    Use this tool to extract content from PowerPoint presentation files (PPTX). The tool parses slide data, including
    text, titles, bullet points, and other slide content. Ideal for tasks requiring analysis, summarization, or
    question-answering based on the content of PPTX slides. This tool enables processing of multi-slide presentations
    with structured output for each slide, making the content easier to interpret and utilize in further
    reasoning tasks

PDF_TOOL = ToolMetadata(
    name="pdf_tool",
    description="""
    A specialized tool for extracting content from PDF documents. This tool supports text extraction from both the
    main document and embedded elements such as tables and images. Additionally, it leverages LLM-based image
    recognition to extract text from embedded images within PDFs. This is useful for processing scanned documents,
    extracting knowledge from PDF reports, or summarizing document content. Use this tool when dealing with any PDF
    file requiring text-based or image-based information retrieval

CSV_TOOL = ToolMetadata(
    name="csv_tool",
    description="""
    Tool for interpreting and working with tabular data inside CSV files. This tool allows for
    structured data handling, such as column-based querying, applying filters, aggregations, and analysis of numeric or
    textual data. Use this tool when tasks involve extracting insights or calculations from CSV datasets, or when
    reasoning over structured tabular data is required.

    label="CSV Interpretation",

EXCEL_TOOL = ToolMetadata(
    name="excel_tool",
    description="""
    Use this tool to extract and analyze content from Excel files (XLS, XLSX, XLSB). The tool processes spreadsheet data,
    converting it into readable markdown tables. It can handle multiple sheets, filter out empty rows and columns,
    and filter rows based on multiple cell values with AND logic. Works with pivot tables and complex Excel layouts.
    Ideal for tasks requiring analysis, data extraction, or question-answering based on tabular data in Excel format.

    Key capabilities:
    - Process all sheets or specify sheets by name using the `sheet_names` parameter
    - Get a list of all sheet names in an Excel file with `get_sheet_names=True`
    - Access a specific sheet by its index (0-based) using `sheet_index` parameter
    - Get comprehensive statistics about the Excel file with `get_stats=True` (includes sheet counts, column names, data types, sample values)
    - Control sheet visibility with `visible_only=True/False` parameter to include or exclude hidden sheets
    - **Filter rows by multiple values**: Use `filter_values` (list) to include only rows containing ALL specified values (AND logic)
    - **Filter modes**: Control matching with `filter_mode`: 'exact' (default) for exact matches, 'contains' for substring matches
    - Works with complex layouts: Filtering searches across all cells in a row, not just specific columns
    - Each filter value can appear in any cell of the row (OR logic within each value)
    - Automatically normalize column names for better readability
    - Process multiple Excel files with clear separation between documents
    - Intelligent data cleaning to remove empty rows and columns

    Examples:
    - Single exact match: `filter_values=["NATI-5DME"]` to get rows containing "NATI-5DME"
    - Multiple values (AND): `filter_values=["Critical", "Open", "Bug"]` returns only rows containing all three values
    - Substring match: `filter_values=["NATI"]` with `filter_mode="contains"` to get rows containing "NATI" anywhere
    - Complex filtering: `filter_values=["Sprint 42", "In Progress", "John"]` finds rows with all three criteria
    - Status + Type filtering: `filter_values=["Complete", "Feature"]` for rows matching both criteria

    - "instructions" - Add specific instructions for how to analyze the document (use with "analyze" or "summary" queries)
    - "pages" - Specify which pages to process: single page ("1"), multiple pages ("1,3,5"), or range ("1-4")

    Examples:
    - To read a document: Use query="text"
    - To summarize a document: Use query="summary"
    - To analyze specific aspects: Use query="analyze" with instructions="Identify key arguments in this legal document"
