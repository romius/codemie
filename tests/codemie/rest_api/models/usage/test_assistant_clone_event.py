    Regression test for EPMCDME-10889 bug:
    AssistantCloneEventSQL was inheriting from BaseModelWithSQLSupport which adds 'date' and
    'update_date' fields via CommonBaseModel, but the migration only created 4 columns
    (id, assistant_id, user_id, created_at).

    When inserting, SQLModel tried to write to non-existent 'date' and 'update_date' columns,
    causing: psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column "date" of relation "assistant_clone_event" does not exist

    Fix: AssistantCloneEventSQL now inherits from plain SQLModel, no unwanted fields.
    This test ensures the model.dump() has ONLY the 4 required fields.
