Test Area: Iteration and Map-Reduce

Tests for iteration patterns, map-reduce operations, context cloning,
parallel execution, and iteration control flow.

This module tests the following critical functionality:
- Basic map operation with iter_key
- Context cloning for parallel branches
- Reduce operation after map (result collection)
- JSON pointer iteration
- Task dictionary in iterations
- FIRST_STATE_IN_ITERATION flag
- Iteration counter tracking
- Parallel iteration isolation
- Nested iterations
- Iteration termination with finish_iteration flag
